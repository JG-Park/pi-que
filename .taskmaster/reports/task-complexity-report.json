      "taskTitle": "Setup New Project Structure",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project structure setup into subtasks for initializing the Next.js project, creating each major directory (pages, components, hooks, services, utils), creating placeholder files, and verifying structure with a linter.",
      "reasoning": "This task is foundational but mostly involves repetitive file and folder creation with minimal logic. Complexity is moderate due to the breadth of directories and the need to follow conventions, but there are no intricate algorithms or dependencies."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Hooks",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for refactoring each hook (use-youtube-player, use-youtube-api, use-project), implementing TypeScript typing, integrating third-party libraries (YouTube IFrame API, axios, React Query), and writing unit tests.",
      "reasoning": "Refactoring and improving hooks requires understanding existing logic, integrating APIs, handling async flows, and ensuring robust typing and testing. The need for best practices and error handling increases complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Service Layer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for implementing each service (YouTube API, video search, player control, project CRUD, segment management, queue management, Supabase, local storage), ensuring SOLID principles, and writing unit tests with mocks.",
      "reasoning": "Multiple services with distinct responsibilities, integration with external APIs, and adherence to SOLID principles make this a complex and multi-faceted task."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Business Logic Hooks",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for implementing each business logic hook, integrating required libraries (react-query, immer, react-beautiful-dnd, lodash), handling error/loading states, and writing comprehensive tests.",
      "reasoning": "Each hook encapsulates non-trivial business logic, state management, and third-party integrations, requiring careful design and testing."

      "taskTitle": "Develop UI Component Hooks",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing each UI hook (modal, form state, scroll), integrating with UI libraries, ensuring accessibility, and writing unit tests.",
      "reasoning": "UI hooks are generally less complex than business logic hooks but still require integration with libraries and attention to accessibility and user interaction."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for implementing each utility function (time formatter, validator, video URL parser, video validator, debounce, ID generator, error handler) and writing unit tests for each.",
      "reasoning": "Each utility is straightforward but must be robust and well-tested. The number of utilities increases the overall effort."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop VideoPlayer Component",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for implementing VideoPlayer, VideoControls, VideoInfo, integrating react-player, custom controls, keyboard shortcuts, picture-in-picture, and writing tests.",
      "reasoning": "This component involves media playback, custom controls, accessibility, and performance optimizations, making it moderately complex."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing SegmentManager, SegmentList (with drag-and-drop), SegmentForm (with validation), SegmentItem, optimistic updates, error/loading handling, and tests.",
      "reasoning": "Combines UI, state management, drag-and-drop, form validation, and optimistic updates, requiring careful coordination and testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for implementing QueueManager, QueueList (with drag-and-drop), QueueItem, queue operations, optimistic updates, error/loading handling, and tests.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to SegmentManager but with slightly less complexity due to fewer subcomponents and simpler data structures."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for implementing VideoSearch, SearchInput (with debounce), SearchResults (with virtualization and infinite scroll), SearchItem, error/loading handling, and tests.",
      "reasoning": "Involves data fetching, debouncing, virtualization, and infinite scrolling, each adding to the complexity."
